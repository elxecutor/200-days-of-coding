# Day 031: Random Vector Analysis in MATLAB

This project demonstrates basic vector operations and visualization in MATLAB:

- Generates a random vector of 20 elements between 0 and 1.
- Computes mean, median, and standard deviation of the vector.
- Finds the minimum value and its index.
- Displays the vector and results in the console.
- Plots the vector for visual analysis.

## How to Run
Open `main.m` in MATLAB and run the script. The output will show the vector, statistics, and a plot.

## Learning Objectives
- Practice vector manipulation and statistical analysis in MATLAB.
- Visualize data using line plots.
- Use MATLAB functions like `rand`, `mean`, `median`, `std`, `min`, and plotting tools.
