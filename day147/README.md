## TCP/IP Model and Addressing

The TCP/IP model is the foundation of modern networking. It consists of four layers:
- **Application**: End-user protocols (HTTP, FTP, DNS)
- **Transport**: Reliable/unreliable data transfer (TCP, UDP)
- **Internet**: Routing and addressing (IP)
- **Network Access**: Physical transmission (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)

### Addressing
- **IP Address**: Unique identifier for devices on a network
- **Subnet Mask**: Defines network boundaries
- **MAC Address**: Hardware address for network interfaces

Practical tools: `ip`, `ifconfig`, `ping`, `traceroute` (Linux)
