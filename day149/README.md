## Network Troubleshooting Tools and Commands

Effective troubleshooting requires knowledge of key tools:
- `ping`: Test connectivity to a host
- `traceroute`: Track the path packets take
- `nslookup`/`dig`: Query DNS records
- `netstat`: Display network connections
- `ip`/`ifconfig`: Show and configure network interfaces

Practice using these commands to diagnose and resolve network issues.
