Day 140 - DSA Problem: Two Sum

Problem:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
"""

def two_sum(nums, target):
    """Find indices of two numbers in nums that add up to target."""
    lookup = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in lookup:
            return [lookup[complement], i]
        lookup[num] = i
    return []

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
    target = 9
    result = two_sum(nums, target)
    print(f"Indices: {result}")  # Output: Indices: [0, 1]
