# Day 10: Root Finding with Bisection Method

This folder contains a project focused on implementing the bisection method to find roots of numbers.

---

## Overview

This project emphasizes the importance of modularizing code by using functions. Each function is designed to handle a specific task, such as evaluating the midpoint, checking convergence, or managing edge cases. This approach improves code readability, reusability, and maintainability, making it easier to debug and extend the implementation.
