# Day 039: Random Signal and FFT Analysis

This project generates a random signal, computes its Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and visualizes both the time-domain signal and its frequency spectrum using MATLAB.

## Files
- `main.m`: MATLAB script for random signal generation and FFT analysis.

## Features
- Random signal generation
- FFT computation
- Time-domain and frequency-domain visualization

## Usage
Open `main.m` in MATLAB and run the script to see the random signal and its FFT plot.
