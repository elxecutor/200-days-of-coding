# Day 5: Cube Root and Primality Check

This folder contains two projects: **Cube Root** and **Primality Check**, each focusing on different computational problems and their analysis.

## Cube Root

### Overview
The **Cube Root** project implements a binary search algorithm to compute the cube root of a number. It also measures the number of steps and time taken for the computation, providing insights into the algorithm's efficiency.

### Files and Their Usage
- **`main.py`**: This script contains the implementation of the cube root algorithm. It also generates performance data and saves a graph visualizing the steps and time complexity.
- **`docs/cube_root.png`**: This file stores the generated graph, which provides a visual representation of the algorithm's performance.

## Primality Check

### Overview
The **Primality Check** project determines whether a number is prime using a step-counting algorithm. It also measures the time taken for the computation and visualizes the results.

### Files and Their Usage
- **`main.py`**: This script implements the primality check algorithm. It generates performance data and creates graphs to analyze the relationship between input size, steps, and time taken.
- **`docs/primality_steps_time.png`**: This file contains a graph showing the correlation between input size, steps, and time for primality checks.
