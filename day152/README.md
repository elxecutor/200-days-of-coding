## Routers and Switches

- **Router:** Directs data packets between networks, assigns IP addresses, and connects devices to the internet.
- **Switch:** Connects devices within a local network (LAN), forwards data only to the intended device.

### Key Concepts
- Routing tables
- Layer 2 vs Layer 3 switching
- VLANs (Virtual LANs)

Practical tip: Use `show ip route` and `show vlan` commands on network equipment.
