## Compilers vs Interpreters

### Overview
Compilers and interpreters are tools used to convert high-level programming code into machine-readable instructions. Understanding their differences and use cases is essential for selecting the right tool for a given programming task.

### Key Differences
- **Compilers**: Convert the entire source code into machine code before execution. Commonly used for languages like C and C++.
- **Interpreters**: Execute code line-by-line without producing a separate machine code file. Commonly used for languages like Python and JavaScript.

### Use Cases
- **Compilers**: Suitable for performance-critical applications where execution speed is important.
- **Interpreters**: Ideal for rapid development and debugging due to their interactive nature.
