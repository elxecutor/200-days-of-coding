# Day 030: Random Matrix Analysis in MATLAB

This project demonstrates basic matrix operations and visualization in MATLAB:

- Generates a random 5x5 matrix of integers.
- Calculates the mean and standard deviation for each column.
- Finds the maximum value and its position in the matrix.
- Displays the matrix and results in the console.
- Plots the matrix as a heatmap for visual analysis.

## How to Run
Open `main.m` in MATLAB and run the script. The output will show the matrix, statistics, and a heatmap plot.

## Learning Objectives
- Practice matrix manipulation and statistical analysis in MATLAB.
- Visualize data using heatmaps.
- Use MATLAB functions like `randi`, `mean`, `std`, `max`, and plotting tools.
