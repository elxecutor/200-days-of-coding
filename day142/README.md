## OS Architecture and Components

Operating systems are built from several key components:
- **Kernel:** Core part managing hardware and system resources
- **Shell:** Interface for user commands (CLI or GUI)
- **Device Drivers:** Enable communication with hardware
- **System Libraries:** Provide functions for programs

### Common Architectures
- Monolithic kernel
- Microkernel
- Hybrid kernel

Each architecture has its own advantages and use cases.
