## Understanding CPU Architecture and Performance Evaluation

### Overview
A CPU's architecture defines its design and functionality, including how it processes instructions, manages memory, and interacts with other components. Evaluating CPU performance involves analyzing factors such as clock speed, core count, instruction set, and cache size.

### Importance in Programming
Understanding CPU architecture and performance metrics helps developers write efficient code by optimizing resource usage, reducing bottlenecks, and improving execution speed.
