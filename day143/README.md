## Process and Memory Management

Operating systems manage processes and memory to ensure efficient operation:
- **Process Management:** Handles creation, scheduling, and termination of processes
- **Memory Management:** Allocates and tracks memory usage, prevents conflicts

### Key Concepts
- Multitasking and process states
- Virtual memory and paging
- Swapping and segmentation

Practical tools: `ps`, `top`, `htop`, `free`, `vmstat` (Linux)
