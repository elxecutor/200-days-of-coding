## Data Visualization Methods and Their Best Uses

1. **Line Plot**  
  - **Output:** Continuous data trends over time or sequence.  
  - **Best for:** Time series, progressions, and performance metrics.

2. **Scatter Plot**  
  - **Output:** Individual data points in two dimensions.  
  - **Best for:** Showing relationships or correlations between variables.

3. **Bar Chart**  
  - **Output:** Discrete, categorical data.  
  - **Best for:** Comparing quantities across different categories.

4. **Histogram**  
  - **Output:** Distribution of numerical data.  
  - **Best for:** Visualizing frequency distributions and spotting outliers.

5. **Pie Chart**  
  - **Output:** Proportional parts of a whole.  
  - **Best for:** Displaying percentage breakdowns among categories (use sparingly).

6. **Box Plot**  
  - **Output:** Summary of data spread and variability.  
  - **Best for:** Highlighting median, quartiles, and outliers in datasets.

7. **Heat Map**  
  - **Output:** Data density across two dimensions, often colored.  
  - **Best for:** Visualizing complex correlations or patterns in large datasets.

8. **Network Graph**  
  - **Output:** Nodes and connections.  
  - **Best for:** Representing relationships and interactions in networked data.

**Best Practice:** Always choose the visualization method that best aligns with your data type and the insights you wish to communicate.
