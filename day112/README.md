## OSI Model Layers Explained

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers:

1. **Physical**: Hardware transmission of raw data
2. **Data Link**: Error detection/correction, MAC addressing
3. **Network**: Routing, IP addressing
4. **Transport**: Reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP)
5. **Session**: Managing sessions/connections
6. **Presentation**: Data translation, encryption
7. **Application**: End-user applications (HTTP, FTP, etc.)

Each layer serves a specific function in network communication.

## DSA Problem: Intersection of Two Arrays

**Problem:**
Given two arrays, return their intersection as a list of unique elements.

**Solution:** See `dsa/intersection_of_two_arrays.py` for the Python implementation.
