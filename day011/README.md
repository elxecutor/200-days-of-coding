# Day 11: Exploring Python Collections

This folder contains a project focused on understanding Python's basic data structures—range, list, and tuple—and their behavior.

---

## Overview

In this project, we:
- Demonstrate the use of the **range** object to generate sequences.
- Explore **lists** as mutable sequences with operations like appending.
- Illustrate the immutability of **tuples** and how to create modified copies.

The examples are provided in a Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`), which shows practical code and output for each data type.

## Learnings and Insights

- **Range**: Efficient and immutable for iteration.
- **List**: Flexible and dynamic, allowing for modifications.
- **Tuple**: Immutable, highlighting the need to create new tuples when changes are required.
