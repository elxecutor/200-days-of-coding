# Debugging as a Search Problem

When debugging, you're essentially searching for the source of a problem within your code. Instead of randomly guessing, you can think of this process as exploring a space of potential issues.

- **Define the Problem:** Identify exactly what isn't working and under which conditions.  
- **Formulate Hypotheses:** Consider possible causes that might lead to the error.  
- **Narrow the Search:** Use techniques like binary search in your code to isolate the bug.  
- **Test Assumptions:** Once a potential error source is identified, verify it with tests or logs.  
- **Iterate:** Continue refining your search until the bug is localized and resolved.

This methodical approach helps in systematically identifying and fixing issues, much like solving a search problem.
