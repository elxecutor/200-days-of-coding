# Day 28: Plotting Squares with MATLAB

This project demonstrates how to plot the squares of numbers using MATLAB. The script generates numbers from 1 to 1000, computes their squares using element-wise operations, and visualizes the relationship with a clear, labeled plot.

## Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Visualize the quadratic growth of numbers by plotting each number against its square.

- **Key Steps:**  
  - Generate numbers (1 to 1000).
  - Compute the square of each number.
  - Plot the results with proper labels, title, and grid for enhanced clarity.
