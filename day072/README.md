# Day 072: Random Signal and FFT Analysis

Generates a random signal, computes its FFT, and visualizes both the time-domain signal and its frequency spectrum in MATLAB.

## Features
- Random signal generation
- FFT computation
- Time-domain and frequency-domain visualization

## Usage
Run `main.m` in MATLAB to see the random signal and its FFT plot.
