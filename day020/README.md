# Testing Types

## 8.1.1 Black-Box Testing
This form of testing is conducted without any knowledge of the internal code structure. It allows different teams, such as developers and testers, to independently create test cases. The focus remains solely on the input and output behavior rather than the underlying code. It pays particular attention to boundary conditions and special cases, like handling empty lists or extreme values, to identify issues that might be overlooked due to assumptions in the original specifications.

## 8.1.2 Glass-Box Testing
Also known as white-box testing, this approach derives test cases directly from the internal workings and code paths of the application. It ensures that elements such as every branch, loop, and recursive function are appropriately tested. Although achieving complete path coverage may be challenging, this method can uncover subtle bugs—like off-by-one errors—that might escape notice in black-box testing.
