# Day 8: Sum of Digits

This folder contains a project focused on calculating the sum of digits of a number using recursion.

---

## Overview

The **Sum of Digits** project demonstrates a recursive approach to solving a common mathematical problem. It highlights the power of recursion in breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts.

---

## Learnings and Insights

- **Recursion**: Showcases how recursion can simplify problems by reducing them to smaller subproblems.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Reinforces the use of modulus and integer division for digit extraction.
