## Protocols in Action

- **Ethernet:** Most common wired LAN protocol. Uses frames and MAC addresses.
- **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11):** Wireless LAN protocol. Uses radio waves and encryption.
- **TCP/IP:** Suite of protocols for reliable communication over networks.

### Practical Examples
- Use `ipconfig`/`ifconfig` to view network settings
- Use `ping` and `traceroute` to test connectivity
- Secure Wi-Fi with WPA2/WPA3 encryption

Understanding protocols helps in configuring and troubleshooting networks.
