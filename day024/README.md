# Abstract Data Types and Code Improvement

## Overview
Abstract Data Types (ADTs) allow you to encapsulate data and operations into a coherent unit. This abstraction provides a clear interface for using the type without exposing the underlying implementation. In practice, ADTs help in managing complexity by isolating changes to the implementation while keeping the interface consistent.

## Key Benefits
- **Decomposition:** Breaking early designs into manageable, domain-specific types.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation details, which improves maintainability and scalability.
- **Interface-Implementation Separation:** Users interact with a simple interface, freeing them from needing to know how operations are performed internally.

## Implementing ADTs Using Classes
In Python, ADTs are implemented as classes. Consider the following example, which demonstrates a simple ADT that models a toy collection:

```python
class Toy:
  def __init__(self):
    self._elems = []

  def add(self, new_elems):
    """Add elements to the toy collection."""
    self._elems += new_elems

  def size(self):
    """Return the number of elements in the collection."""
    return len(self._elems)
```

- **Data Abstraction:** The user interacts with methods like add() and size() without needing to know that the data is maintained in a list.
- **Instance vs. Class Attributes:** Instance attributes (such as _elems) help ensure that each object maintains its own state.

## Advanced Example: Int_set ADT
The following snippet shows a more advanced ADT for managing a set of integers. This example demonstrates how to use an interface for set operations while ensuring data integrity through invariants.

```python
class Int_set:
  """Abstract Data Type for a set of integers.
  
  This class maintains a list `vals` containing unique integers.
  """

  def __init__(self):
    self.vals = []

  def insert(self, e):
    """Insert integer `e` into the set if not already present."""
    if e not in self.vals:
      self.vals.append(e)

  def member(self, e):
    """Return True if `e` is a member of the set; False otherwise."""
    return e in self.vals

  def remove(self, e):
    """Remove `e` from the set; raises ValueError if not present."""
    try:
      self.vals.remove(e)
    except ValueError:
      raise ValueError(f'{e} not found')

  def __str__(self):
    """Return a string representation of the set."""
    return "{" + ", ".join(str(e) for e in self.vals) + "}"

  def union(self, other):
    """Mutate self so that it contains exactly the elements in self plus other.
    
    other is an instance of Int_set.
    """
    for e in other.vals:
      if e not in self.vals:
        self.vals.append(e)
```

### Explanation
- **Representation Invariant:** The internal list `vals` must not contain duplicate integers.
- **Interface Methods:** Methods like insert, member, and union provide a simple interface for set manipulation.
- **Union Exercise:** The union method allows you to merge another set into the current set, maintaining the invariant.

## How ADTs Improve Your Coding
- **Maintainability:** Changes to the underlying data structure do not affect code that uses the ADT.
- **Reusability:** ADTs can be reused across different parts of a project or even in different projects.
- **Clarity:** Clearly defined interfaces lead to more understandable and reliable code.

## Summary
Utilizing Abstract Data Types in your projects isolates complexity and promotes a clean, modular design. By defining clear interfaces and encapsulating functionality within classes, you not only simplify maintenance but also create robust and scalable code structures that can evolve over time.
