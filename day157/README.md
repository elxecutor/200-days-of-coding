## Common Network Topologies

- **Bus Topology:** All devices share a single communication line. Simple but not scalable.
- **Star Topology:** All devices connect to a central hub or switch. Easy to manage and troubleshoot.
- **Ring Topology:** Devices form a closed loop. Data travels in one direction.
- **Mesh Topology:** Devices are interconnected. High redundancy and reliability.
- **Hybrid Topology:** Combination of two or more topologies.

Each topology has its own advantages and use cases.
