## Hubs, Bridges, and Repeaters

- **Hub:** Broadcasts data to all devices in a network segment (less secure, rarely used today).
- **Bridge:** Connects and filters traffic between two network segments.
- **Repeater:** Amplifies or regenerates signals to extend network range.

### Key Concepts
- Collision domains
- Network segmentation
- Signal degradation and extension

Practical tip: Use bridges and repeaters to optimize network performance and coverage.
