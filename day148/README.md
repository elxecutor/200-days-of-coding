## Common Protocols

Networking relies on many protocols for communication:
- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** Web browsing
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** File transfers
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Resolves domain names to IP addresses
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Email transmission
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Assigns IP addresses

Each protocol serves a specific purpose in network communication.
