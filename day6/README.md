# Functions, Data Types, and Recursion

This folder contains examples and exercises related to functions, data types, and recursion in Python.

---

## Overview

The focus of Day 6 is to explore:
- **Functions**: Modularizing code for reusability and clarity.
- **Data Types**: Understanding and working with Python's built-in data types.
- **Recursion**: Solving problems using recursive functions.

---

## Usage

It includes:
- Root-finding algorithms.
- Recursive implementations of factorial, Fibonacci, and harmonic sums.
- Palindrome checking using recursion.

---

## Learnings and Insights

- **Functions**: Encapsulation of logic into reusable blocks improves code readability and maintainability.
- **Recursion**: Recursive solutions can simplify complex problems but require careful handling to avoid stack overflow.
- **Data Types**: Understanding Python's data types is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code.
