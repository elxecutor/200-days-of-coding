## File Systems and Permissions

Operating systems use file systems to organize and store data:
- **File System Types:** FAT32, NTFS, ext4, etc.
- **Directory Structure:** Hierarchical organization of files
- **Permissions:** Control access to files and directories (read, write, execute)

### Practical Commands (Linux)
- `ls -l` (list files with permissions)
- `chmod` (change permissions)
- `chown` (change ownership)

Understanding file systems and permissions is essential for security and data management.
